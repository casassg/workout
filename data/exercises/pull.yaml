  # BACK
  - id: "lat_pulldown"
    name: "Lat Pulldown"
    muscle: "Lats"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 4
    reps: "10-12"
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "Primary lat builder"
    description: |
      Setup: Sit at machine with thighs secured under pads. Grip bar wider than shoulder-width with overhand grip. Lean back slightly (10-15°), chest up.
      
      Execution: Pull bar down to upper chest, leading with elbows. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the bottom. Slowly return to start with arms fully extended.
      
      Key points: Don't lean back excessively or swing. Pull elbows down and back, not just down. Feel lats stretch at the top. Imagine pulling your elbows into your back pockets.

    muscle: "Mid Back"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 4
    reps: "10-12"
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "Builds back thickness"
    description: |
      Setup: Sit with feet on platform, knees slightly bent. Grab V-handle or close-grip attachment. Start with arms extended, slight forward lean from hips (not rounded back).
      
      Execution: Pull handle to lower chest/upper abs while sitting up tall. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the end. Return slowly, letting shoulders reach forward slightly for stretch.
      
      Key points: Keep chest up throughout. Don't rock back and forth - movement comes from arms and back. Let shoulders protract at the stretch, retract at the contraction. Control the weight.

    name: "Single-Arm Cable Row"
    muscle: "Lats, Mid Back"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "10-12 each"
    startingWeight: 10
    notes: "Allows rotation and full range of motion"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to mid-height. Stand facing machine in split stance (opposite leg forward). Grab handle with one hand, arm extended toward cable.
      
      Execution: Pull handle to your side/hip, rotating torso slightly toward working side. Squeeze lat and mid-back at contraction. Return slowly, allowing full stretch and slight torso rotation.
      
      Key points: The rotation is what makes this special - use it! Feel your lat stretch as arm extends. Pull elbow back past your body. Keep core braced. Work each side equally.

    name: "Straight-Arm Pulldown"
    muscle: "Lats"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 10
    notes: "Lat isolation - great mind-muscle connection"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to high position with straight bar or rope. Stand facing machine, arms extended at ~45° angle, slight bend in elbows. Hinge slightly at hips.
      
      Execution: Keeping arms nearly straight (slight bend locked in), pull bar down in an arc to your thighs. Squeeze lats hard at bottom. Return slowly along same arc.
      
      Key points: Arms stay straight-ish throughout - this is NOT a pulldown. Think about pushing the bar down with your elbows/armpits. Really focus on feeling your lats. Light weight, high reps.

  # BICEPS
  - id: "barbell_curl"
    name: "Barbell Curl"
    muscle: "Biceps"
    equipment: "Barbell"
    sets: 3
    reps: "10-12"
    startingWeight: 15
    notes: "Classic bicep mass builder"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip barbell with underhand grip, hands shoulder-width. Arms hang straight down, bar at thighs.
      
      Execution: Keeping upper arms pinned to sides, curl bar up toward shoulders. Squeeze biceps at top. Lower slowly under control, resisting gravity.
      
      Key points: Upper arms should NOT move - no swinging! Keep elbows at your sides throughout. Don't lean back. If you have to swing, the weight is too heavy. Control the negative.

    name: "Incline Dumbbell Curl"
    muscle: "Biceps (Long Head)"
    equipment: "Dumbbells + Incline Bench"
    sets: 3
    reps: "10-12"
    startingWeight: 6
    notes: "Maximum bicep stretch for long head"
    description: |
      Setup: Set bench to 45-60° incline. Sit back with dumbbells hanging straight down at sides. Palms face forward. Let arms hang fully extended.
      
      Execution: Curl dumbbells up toward shoulders, keeping upper arms still. Squeeze at top. Lower slowly, feeling the stretch at bottom when arms are fully extended.
      
      Key points: The incline puts your biceps in a stretched position - that's the point. Don't lift upper arms. Get a FULL stretch at bottom. Use lighter weight than standing curls.

    muscle: "Biceps, Brachialis"
    equipment: "Dumbbells"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 8
    notes: "Builds arm thickness and forearms"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Hold dumbbells at sides with neutral grip (palms facing your body/thighs).
      
      Execution: Keeping palms facing in (neutral grip), curl dumbbells up toward shoulders. Squeeze at top. Lower slowly under control.
      
      Key points: The neutral grip shifts emphasis to brachialis (under bicep) and forearms. Keep elbows pinned to sides. Don't swing. Can do alternating or both arms together.
