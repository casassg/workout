  # CHEST
  - id: "bench_press"
    name: "Bench Press"
    muscle: "Chest"
    equipment: "Barbell + Bench"
    sets: 4
    reps: "8-12"
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "The foundational chest exercise"
    description: |
      Setup: Lie on bench with eyes under the bar. Grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Plant feet flat on floor.
      
      Execution: Unrack and lower bar to mid-chest (nipple line) with elbows at ~45° angle. Touch chest lightly, then press up in a slight arc back toward face. Lock out at top.
      
      Key points: Keep shoulder blades squeezed together throughout. Maintain natural arch in lower back. Don't bounce off chest. Breathe in on the way down, exhale pressing up.

    muscle: "Upper Chest"
    equipment: "Dumbbells + Incline Bench"
    sets: 3
    reps: "10-12"
    startingWeight: 8
    notes: "Targets upper chest for balanced development"
    description: |
      Setup: Set bench to 30-45° incline. Sit with dumbbells on thighs, then kick them up as you lie back. Start with dumbbells at shoulder level, palms facing forward.
      
      Execution: Press dumbbells up and slightly inward until they nearly touch at the top. Lower under control to shoulder level, feeling a stretch in upper chest.
      
      Key points: Don't let elbows flare out past 90°. Keep wrists straight, not bent back. Lower back stays on bench. The incline shifts work to upper chest fibers.

    muscle: "Chest"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 5
    notes: "Isolation movement for chest squeeze"
    description: |
      Setup: Set both pulleys to shoulder height or slightly above. Grab handles and step forward into a staggered stance. Start with arms out wide, slight bend in elbows.
      
      Execution: Bring hands together in a hugging motion, squeezing chest hard at the center. Slowly return to start, feeling the stretch across your chest.
      
      Key points: Keep the same bend in your elbows throughout - this isn't a pressing motion. Focus on squeezing your chest to move the weight, not your arms. Control the negative.

  # SHOULDERS
  - id: "overhead_press"
    name: "Overhead Press"
    muscle: "Shoulders"
    equipment: "Barbell"
    sets: 4
    reps: "8-10"
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "Primary shoulder builder"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip bar just outside shoulders, bar resting on front delts/upper chest. Elbows slightly in front of bar.
      
      Execution: Brace core hard, squeeze glutes. Press bar straight up, moving head back slightly to let bar pass, then forward once bar clears. Lock out overhead with bar over mid-foot.
      
      Key points: Don't lean back excessively - this isn't an incline press. Keep core tight to protect lower back. Full lockout at top. Bar path should be as vertical as possible.

    name: "Cable Lateral Raise"
    muscle: "Side Delts"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 2.5
    notes: "Builds shoulder width"
    description: |
      Setup: Set pulley to lowest position. Stand sideways to machine, grab handle with far hand (cable crosses in front of body). Slight bend in elbow, locked in place.
      
      Execution: Raise arm out to the side until parallel with floor or slightly above. Lead with your elbow, not your hand. Lower slowly under control.
      
      Key points: Keep slight forward lean to target side delt better. Don't swing or use momentum. Think about pouring water from a pitcher at the top. Pinky slightly higher than thumb.

  - id: "face_pull"
    name: "Face Pull"
    muscle: "Rear Delts"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "15-20"
    startingWeight: 5
    notes: "Essential for shoulder health and posture"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to face height with rope attachment. Grip rope with thumbs pointing back toward you. Step back to create tension, arms extended.
      
      Execution: Pull rope toward your face, separating hands as you pull. Aim to bring hands beside your ears. Squeeze shoulder blades together and externally rotate (thumbs pointing back).
      
      Key points: This is a rear delt AND rotator cuff exercise. Pull apart, not just back. Hold the squeeze for a second. Don't let your elbows drop - keep them high. Light weight, high reps.

  # TRICEPS
  - id: "tricep_pushdown"
    name: "Tricep Pushdown"
    muscle: "Triceps"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 10
    notes: "Classic tricep isolation"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to high position with straight bar or V-bar. Stand facing machine, grip bar with overhand grip. Tuck elbows tight to your sides.
      
      Execution: Keeping upper arms completely still, extend forearms down until arms are straight. Squeeze triceps hard at bottom. Slowly return to start position (forearms parallel to floor).
      
      Key points: Elbows stay pinned to your sides throughout - they should not move forward or back. Only your forearms move. Don't lean over the weight. Squeeze at the bottom.

    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 7.5
    notes: "Targets long head of triceps"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to low position with rope attachment. Face away from machine, grab rope with both hands overhead. Step forward, lean slightly forward with arms extended overhead.
      
      Execution: Keeping upper arms still and close to head, lower the rope behind your head by bending elbows. Feel the stretch in triceps. Extend arms back up, squeezing triceps at top.
      
      Key points: Upper arms stay vertical and close to ears - only forearms move. Don't let elbows flare out wide. Get a full stretch at the bottom. This position emphasizes the long head (inner tricep).
