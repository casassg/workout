  # CHEST
  - id: "bench_press"
    name: "Bench Press"
    muscle: "Chest"
    equipment: "Barbell + Bench"
    sets: 4
    reps: 8
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "The foundational chest exercise"
    description: |
      Setup: Lie on bench with eyes under the bar. Grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Plant feet flat on floor.
      
      Execution: Unrack and lower bar to mid-chest (nipple line) with elbows at ~45° angle. Touch chest lightly, then press up in a slight arc back toward face. Lock out at top.
      
      Key points: Keep shoulder blades squeezed together throughout. Maintain natural arch in lower back. Don't bounce off chest. Breathe in on the way down, exhale pressing up.

        name: "Chest Press Machine"
        equipment: "Technogym Chest Press"
        description: |
          Setup: Adjust seat height so handles are at mid-chest level. Sit with back flat against pad, feet flat on floor. Grip handles with overhand grip.
          
          Execution: Press handles forward until arms are extended (don't lock elbows). Squeeze chest at the end. Return slowly, feeling stretch across chest.
          
          Key points: Keep shoulder blades squeezed together. Don't let shoulders roll forward. Control the weight on return. Great for beginners or when benches are busy.
      - id: "dumbbell_bench_press"
        name: "Dumbbell Bench Press"
        equipment: "Dumbbells + Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Sit on bench with dumbbells on thighs. Kick them up as you lie back, positioning them at shoulder level. Palms face forward, feet flat on floor.
          
          Execution: Press dumbbells up until arms are extended, bringing them slightly together at top. Lower slowly to shoulder level, elbows at ~45° angle.
          
          Key points: Allows greater range of motion than barbell. Keep shoulder blades squeezed together. Each arm works independently, fixing imbalances. Control the descent.

  - id: "incline_dumbbell_press"
    name: "Incline Dumbbell Press"
    muscle: "Upper Chest"
    equipment: "Dumbbells + Incline Bench"
    sets: 3
    reps: 10
    startingWeight: 8
    notes: "Targets upper chest for balanced development"
    description: |
      Setup: Set bench to 30-45° incline. Sit with dumbbells on thighs, then kick them up as you lie back. Start with dumbbells at shoulder level, palms facing forward.
      
      Execution: Press dumbbells up and slightly inward until they nearly touch at the top. Lower under control to shoulder level, feeling a stretch in upper chest.
      
      Key points: Don't let elbows flare out past 90°. Keep wrists straight, not bent back. Lower back stays on bench. The incline shifts work to upper chest fibers.

      - id: "incline_cable_fly"
        name: "Incline Cable Fly"
        equipment: "Dual Pulley + Incline Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Set pulleys to low position. Place incline bench (30-45°) between cables. Grab handles, lie back on bench with arms out wide, slight bend in elbows.
          
          Execution: Bring hands together in an arc above upper chest, squeezing hard at top. Lower slowly, feeling stretch across upper chest.
          
          Key points: Keep same elbow bend throughout - this is a fly, not a press. Focus on squeezing upper chest. Constant cable tension makes this excellent for mind-muscle connection.
      - id: "incline_barbell_press"
        name: "Incline Barbell Press"
        equipment: "Barbell + Incline Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Set bench to 30-45° incline. Lie back with eyes under bar. Grip slightly wider than shoulders. Unrack and hold bar at arm's length above upper chest.
          
          Execution: Lower bar to upper chest (just below collarbone). Touch lightly, then press up and slightly back. Lock out at top.
          
          Key points: Keep shoulder blades squeezed. Bar path is slightly diagonal - not straight up. Don't let elbows flare too wide. Targets upper chest more than flat bench.

  - id: "cable_fly"
    name: "Cable Fly"
    muscle: "Chest"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: 12
    startingWeight: 5
    notes: "Isolation movement for chest squeeze"
    description: |
      Setup: Set both pulleys to shoulder height or slightly above. Grab handles and step forward into a staggered stance. Start with arms out wide, slight bend in elbows.
      
      Execution: Bring hands together in a hugging motion, squeezing chest hard at the center. Slowly return to start, feeling the stretch across your chest.
      
      Key points: Keep the same bend in your elbows throughout - this isn't a pressing motion. Focus on squeezing your chest to move the weight, not your arms. Control the negative.
    alternatives:
      - id: "dumbbell_fly"
        name: "Dumbbell Fly"
        equipment: "Dumbbells + Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on flat bench holding dumbbells above chest, palms facing each other. Slight bend in elbows, locked in place.
          
          Execution: Lower dumbbells out to sides in wide arc until you feel stretch across chest (arms roughly parallel to floor). Bring them back together above chest, squeezing chest.
          
          Key points: Keep elbow bend constant - don't turn this into a press. Go lighter than you think - deep stretch can be intense. Control the negative. Great for chest isolation.
      - id: "pec_deck"
        name: "Pec Deck Machine"
        equipment: "Machine"
        description: |
          Setup: Adjust seat so handles are at chest height. Sit with back flat against pad. Place forearms against pads (or grip handles, depending on machine type).
          
          Execution: Bring arms together in front of chest, squeezing pecs hard. Hold contraction briefly. Return slowly to starting position, feeling chest stretch.
          
          Key points: Don't let shoulders roll forward. Keep slight bend in elbows if using handles. Control the weight - don't let it slam back. Excellent for isolating chest without balance concerns.

  # SHOULDERS
  - id: "overhead_press"
    name: "Overhead Press"
    muscle: "Shoulders"
    equipment: "Barbell"
    sets: 4
    reps: 8
    startingWeight: 20
    notes: "Primary shoulder builder"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip bar just outside shoulders, bar resting on front delts/upper chest. Elbows slightly in front of bar.
      
      Execution: Brace core hard, squeeze glutes. Press bar straight up, moving head back slightly to let bar pass, then forward once bar clears. Lock out overhead with bar over mid-foot.
      
      Key points: Don't lean back excessively - this isn't an incline press. Keep core tight to protect lower back. Full lockout at top. Bar path should be as vertical as possible.
    alternatives:
      - id: "shoulder_press_machine"
        name: "Shoulder Press Machine"
        equipment: "Technogym Shoulder Press"
        description: |
          Setup: Adjust seat so handles are at shoulder level. Sit with back flat against pad, feet flat on floor. Grip handles with overhand grip.
          
          Execution: Press handles overhead until arms are extended (don't lock elbows hard). Lower slowly to starting position.
          
          Key points: Keep back against pad - don't arch excessively. Controlled movement throughout. Great for beginners or when fatigued. Safer than free weights for heavy loads.
      - id: "dumbbell_shoulder_press"
        name: "Dumbbell Shoulder Press"
        equipment: "Dumbbells"
        description: |
          Setup: Sit on bench with back support or stand. Hold dumbbells at shoulder level, palms facing forward. Elbows below wrists.
          
          Execution: Press dumbbells overhead, bringing them slightly together at top. Lower slowly to shoulder level.
          
          Key points: Don't lean back excessively. Allows natural wrist rotation. Each arm works independently. Can be done seated or standing - standing requires more core engagement.

  - id: "lateral_raise_cable"
    name: "Cable Lateral Raise"
    muscle: "Side Delts"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: 12
    startingWeight: 2.5
    notes: "Builds shoulder width"
    description: |
      Setup: Set pulley to lowest position. Stand sideways to machine, grab handle with far hand (cable crosses in front of body). Slight bend in elbow, locked in place.
      
      Execution: Raise arm out to the side until parallel with floor or slightly above. Lead with your elbow, not your hand. Lower slowly under control.
      
      Key points: Keep slight forward lean to target side delt better. Don't swing or use momentum. Think about pouring water from a pitcher at the top. Pinky slightly higher than thumb.

          Execution: Raise arms out to sides until parallel with floor (or slightly above). Lead with elbows, not hands. Lower slowly with control.
          
          Key points: Slight forward lean helps target side delts. Don't swing or use momentum. Think "pour water from a pitcher" at top - pinky slightly higher than thumb. Light weight, high reps.

  - id: "face_pull"
    name: "Face Pull"
    muscle: "Rear Delts"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: 15
    startingWeight: 5
    notes: "Essential for shoulder health and posture"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to face height with rope attachment. Grip rope with thumbs pointing back toward you. Step back to create tension, arms extended.
      
      Execution: Pull rope toward your face, separating hands as you pull. Aim to bring hands beside your ears. Squeeze shoulder blades together and externally rotate (thumbs pointing back).
      
      Key points: This is a rear delt AND rotator cuff exercise. Pull apart, not just back. Hold the squeeze for a second. Don't let your elbows drop - keep them high. Light weight, high reps.

          Setup: Bend at hips until torso is nearly parallel to floor (or sit on bench and lean forward). Hold dumbbells hanging below chest with slight elbow bend.
          
          Execution: Raise dumbbells out to sides, leading with elbows. Squeeze rear delts at top. Lower slowly with control.
          
          Key points: Keep torso stable - don't swing up. Slight bend in elbows stays constant. Focus on rear delts, not traps. Light weight, higher reps. Great for posture and shoulder health.
      - id: "reverse_cable_fly"
        name: "Reverse Cable Fly"
        equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
        description: |
          Setup: Set cables to shoulder height. Stand between cables, grab left handle with right hand and right handle with left (cables cross). Step back to create tension.
          
          Execution: Pull hands apart and back, squeezing rear delts and upper back. Hold contraction briefly. Return slowly with control.
          
          Key points: Keep slight bend in elbows. Squeeze shoulder blades together at contraction. Constant cable tension is excellent for rear delt development. Don't use momentum.

  # TRICEPS
  - id: "tricep_pushdown"
    name: "Tricep Pushdown"
    muscle: "Triceps"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: 12
    startingWeight: 10
    notes: "Classic tricep isolation"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to high position with straight bar or V-bar. Stand facing machine, grip bar with overhand grip. Tuck elbows tight to your sides.
      
      Execution: Keeping upper arms completely still, extend forearms down until arms are straight. Squeeze triceps hard at bottom. Slowly return to start position (forearms parallel to floor).
      
      Key points: Elbows stay pinned to your sides throughout - they should not move forward or back. Only your forearms move. Don't lean over the weight. Squeeze at the bottom.
    alternatives:
      - id: "rope_pushdown"
        name: "Rope Pushdown"
        equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley + Rope"
        description: |
          Setup: Attach rope to high pulley. Stand facing machine, grip rope with neutral grip (palms facing each other). Tuck elbows to sides.
          
          Execution: Push rope down, spreading ends apart at bottom to squeeze triceps harder. Return slowly to starting position with forearms parallel to floor.
          
          Key points: Elbows stay pinned to sides throughout. The rope allows you to spread at bottom for extra contraction. Don't lean over the weight. Control both directions.
      - id: "close_grip_bench"
        name: "Close-Grip Bench Press"
        equipment: "Barbell + Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on bench, grip bar with hands about shoulder-width apart (closer than regular bench). Unrack and hold above chest.
          
          Execution: Lower bar to lower chest/sternum, keeping elbows closer to body. Touch chest, then press up. Lock out at top.
          
          Key points: Hands shouldn't be too close - shoulder-width works. Elbows stay tighter to body than regular bench. This is a compound tricep exercise - can go heavier than isolation moves.

  - id: "overhead_tricep_extension"
    name: "Overhead Cable Extension"
    muscle: "Triceps"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: 12
    startingWeight: 7.5
    notes: "Targets long head of triceps"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to low position with rope attachment. Face away from machine, grab rope with both hands overhead. Step forward, lean slightly forward with arms extended overhead.
      
      Execution: Keeping upper arms still and close to head, lower the rope behind your head by bending elbows. Feel the stretch in triceps. Extend arms back up, squeezing triceps at top.
      
      Key points: Upper arms stay vertical and close to ears - only forearms move. Don't let elbows flare out wide. Get a full stretch at the bottom. This position emphasizes the long head (inner tricep).
