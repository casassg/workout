    name: "Leg Extension"
    muscle: "Quads"
    equipment: "Technogym Leg Machine"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 15
    notes: "Quad isolation - great for warming up knees"
    description: |
      Setup: Adjust machine so knee joint aligns with machine pivot point. Back flat against pad. Ankle pad rests on lower shins, just above ankles. Grip handles at sides.
      
      Execution: Extend legs until straight, squeezing quads hard at the top. Hold briefly. Lower slowly under control, stopping just before weights touch.
      
      Key points: Don't swing or use momentum. Keep back against pad. Full extension at top for peak contraction. Control especially important on the way down. Great as a warm-up or finisher.

    muscle: "Hamstrings"
    equipment: "Technogym Leg Machine"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 15
    notes: "Hamstring isolation - important for runners"
    description: |
      Setup: Lying face down (or seated depending on machine), position ankle pad just above heels. Knee joint should align with machine pivot. Grip handles for stability.
      
      Execution: Curl heels toward glutes, squeezing hamstrings hard at peak contraction. Hold briefly. Lower slowly, maintaining tension until legs are almost straight.
      
      Key points: Don't lift hips off pad when curling. Full range of motion - complete stretch at bottom, full contraction at top. Keep toes pointed or slightly flexed (not pointed hard). Control the negative.

    muscle: "Calves"
    equipment: "Barbell or Bodyweight"
    sets: 3
    reps: "15-20"
    startingWeight: 0
    notes: "Calves need high reps and full range"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand on edge of step or weight plate with heels hanging off. Hold barbell on back, dumbbells at sides, or use bodyweight. Start with heels dropped below the step.
      
      Execution: Rise up onto toes as high as possible, squeezing calves hard at top. Hold 1-2 seconds. Lower slowly until heels drop below step level for full stretch.
      
      Key points: Full range of motion is crucial for calves. Don't bounce. Pause at both top and bottom. Go slow - calves respond to time under tension. Keep legs straight (slight knee bend OK).

    muscle: "Quads, Glutes"
    equipment: "Dumbbells or Bodyweight"
    sets: 3
    reps: "10 each leg"
    startingWeight: 0
    notes: "Functional movement - great for runners"
    description: |
      Setup: Stand tall holding dumbbells at sides (or bodyweight). Feet together, core braced.
      
      Execution: Step forward with one leg, lowering until both knees are at ~90°. Front knee stays over ankle (not past toes). Back knee nearly touches floor. Push through front heel to step forward into next lunge.
      
      Key points: Keep torso upright - don't lean forward. Take long enough steps that back knee goes straight down. Push through the heel, not toes. Control your descent. Alternate legs as you walk.
