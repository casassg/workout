  - id: "cable_crunch"
    name: "Cable Crunch"
    muscle: "Abs"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "15-20"
    startingWeight: 10
    notes: "Weighted ab exercise for progression"
    description: |
      Setup: Attach rope to high pulley. Kneel facing machine, grab rope with both hands and hold at forehead/temples. Keep hands in place throughout.
      
      Execution: Crunch DOWN by curling ribcage toward pelvis. Imagine trying to bring your sternum to your belly button. Squeeze abs hard at bottom. Return to start position slowly.
      
      Key points: This is a crunch, not a bow - your hips should NOT move back. The movement comes from your spine curling, not your whole body hinging. Keep hands at head level. Focus on abs doing the work.

        name: "Crunches"
        equipment: "Bodyweight"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on back with knees bent, feet flat on floor. Hands behind head (don't pull on neck) or crossed on chest.
          
          Execution: Curl shoulders and upper back off floor by contracting abs. Focus on bringing ribcage toward pelvis. Hold briefly at top. Lower slowly with control.
          
          Key points: Small range of motion - don't sit all the way up. Don't pull on your neck. Exhale as you crunch up. Keep lower back pressed into floor. Quality over quantity.
      - id: "ab_wheel"
        name: "Ab Wheel Rollout"
        equipment: "Ab Wheel"
        description: |
          Setup: Kneel on mat, hands gripping ab wheel on floor in front of knees. Arms extended, core braced.
          
          Execution: Slowly roll wheel forward, extending body toward floor while keeping core tight. Go only as far as you can control. Roll back by contracting abs, pulling wheel back to start.
          
          Key points: Don't let lower back sag - if it does, you've gone too far. Keep core braced throughout. Start with small range, progress further over time. Very challenging - one of the best ab exercises.

  - id: "hanging_leg_raise"
    name: "Hanging Leg Raise"
    muscle: "Lower Abs"
    equipment: "Pull-up Bar / Rack"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12-15"
    startingWeight: 0
    notes: "Challenging lower ab exercise"
    description: |
      Setup: Hang from pull-up bar with overhand grip, arms fully extended. Let body hang straight. Engage shoulders (don't just hang passively).
      
      Execution: Keeping legs straight (or slightly bent if needed), raise them until at least parallel to floor. For extra work, curl hips up at top. Lower slowly with control.
      
      Key points: Don't swing! If you can't control the movement, bend knees (knee raises) until stronger. The key is lifting with abs by tilting pelvis, not just using hip flexors. Control the descent.
    alternatives:
      - id: "lying_leg_raise"
        name: "Lying Leg Raise"
        equipment: "Floor / Bench"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on back on floor or bench. Hands at sides or under lower back for support. Legs extended, feet together.
          
          Execution: Keeping legs straight (or slightly bent), raise them until perpendicular to floor. Lower slowly with control, stopping just before feet touch ground.
          
          Key points: Don't let lower back arch off floor - press it down. Control the lowering especially. Can bend knees slightly if hamstrings are tight. Targets lower abs effectively.
      - id: "captain_chair_raise"
        name: "Captain's Chair Leg Raise"
        equipment: "Captain's Chair"
        description: |
          Setup: Position yourself in captain's chair with forearms on pads, back against backrest. Legs hanging straight down.
          
          Execution: Raise knees toward chest (or legs straight for more difficulty) by contracting abs and tilting pelvis. Lower slowly with control.
          
          Key points: Don't swing - control the movement. Focus on curling pelvis up, not just lifting legs. Keep upper body stable. Great progression from floor leg raises.

  - id: "plank"
    name: "Plank"
    muscle: "Core"
    equipment: "Bodyweight"
    sets: 3
    reps: "45-60s"
    startingWeight: 0
    notes: "Foundational core stability"
    description: |
      Setup: Start face down, then prop yourself on forearms (elbows under shoulders) and toes. Body forms straight line from head to heels.
      
      Execution: Hold position, bracing core as if about to be punched in stomach. Squeeze glutes. Breathe steadily. Maintain for prescribed time.
      
      Key points: Don't let hips sag (most common error) or pike up. Head neutral - look at floor just ahead of hands. Squeeze everything - abs, glutes, quads. If too easy, try longer holds or add weight on back.
    alternatives:
      - id: "side_plank"
        name: "Side Plank"
        equipment: "Bodyweight"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on side, prop yourself on forearm (elbow under shoulder). Stack feet or stagger them. Lift hips so body forms straight line from head to feet.
          
          Execution: Hold position, bracing core and squeezing glutes. Don't let hips sag. Breathe steadily. Switch sides after completing time.
          
          Key points: Targets obliques and lateral core stability. Keep body in straight line - no sagging or piking. Can make easier by bending bottom knee. For more challenge, lift top leg or arm.
      - id: "dead_bug"
        name: "Dead Bug"
        equipment: "Bodyweight"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on back with arms extended toward ceiling and knees bent 90° (thighs vertical). Press lower back into floor.
          
          Execution: Slowly extend one arm overhead while extending opposite leg, keeping lower back pressed down. Return to start and repeat other side.
          
          Key points: The key is keeping lower back pressed into floor throughout - if it arches, you've gone too far. Slow, controlled movement. Great for core stability and coordination. Easier on back than many ab exercises.

  - id: "wood_chop"
    name: "Cable Wood Chop"
    muscle: "Obliques"
    equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
    sets: 3
    reps: "12 each side"
    startingWeight: 5
    notes: "Rotational core strength"
    description: |
      Setup: Set cable to high position with single handle. Stand sideways to machine, feet wider than shoulders. Grab handle with both hands, arms extended toward cable.
      
      Execution: Pull cable diagonally across body from high to low (like chopping wood), rotating through torso. Arms stay relatively straight - power comes from core rotation. Return slowly.
      
      Key points: Rotate through your core, not just your arms. Keep hips relatively stable - movement is in torso. Control both directions. Can also do low-to-high (reverse wood chop) for variety.

      - id: "russian_twist"
        name: "Russian Twist"
        equipment: "Bodyweight / Dumbbell"
        description: |
          Setup: Sit on floor with knees bent, feet elevated or on ground. Lean back slightly (torso at ~45° angle). Hold weight at chest or clasp hands together.
          
          Execution: Rotate torso to one side, bringing hands/weight toward floor beside hip. Rotate to other side. Keep core tight throughout.
          
          Key points: Movement comes from torso rotation, not just arm movement. Keep chest up. Can hold feet down for stability. Go slow and controlled. Great for obliques.
      - id: "pallof_press"
        name: "Pallof Press"
        equipment: "Dual Adjustable Pulley"
        description: |
          Setup: Set cable to chest height. Stand sideways to machine, grip handle with both hands at chest. Step away to create tension. Feet shoulder-width apart.
          
          Execution: Press handle straight out from chest, resisting rotation. Hold extended position, then return to chest. The cable tries to rotate you - resist it.
          
          Key points: This is an anti-rotation exercise - you're resisting movement, not creating it. Keep core braced throughout. Don't let cable pull you around. Great for functional core strength.

  - id: "reverse_crunch"
    name: "Reverse Crunch"
    muscle: "Lower Abs"
    equipment: "Bench / Floor"
    sets: 3
    reps: "15-20"
    startingWeight: 0
    notes: "Lower ab focus without hanging"
    description: |
      Setup: Lie on back on floor or bench. Hands at sides (or grip bench behind head for stability). Lift legs with knees bent at 90°, thighs vertical.
      
      Execution: Curl hips up off floor/bench by contracting lower abs, bringing knees toward chest. Your tailbone should lift. Lower slowly until hips touch again, keeping legs up.
      
      Key points: Don't swing legs - use abs to curl hips up. The movement is small but targeted. Think about tilting pelvis toward ribcage. Keep upper back on surface. Control is key.
    alternatives:
      - id: "knee_raise"
        name: "Knee Raise"
        equipment: "Bodyweight"
        description: |
          Setup: Lie on back with legs extended, hands at sides or under lower back. Keep lower back pressed into floor.
          
          Execution: Bring knees toward chest by curling pelvis up. Squeeze lower abs at top. Lower legs back down slowly with control, stopping just before feet touch ground.
          
          Key points: Focus on tilting pelvis up, not just moving legs. Keep lower back pressed down. Easier than straight leg raises but still effective. Control the negative.
      - id: "mountain_climbers"
        name: "Mountain Climbers"
        equipment: "Bodyweight"
        description: |
          Setup: Start in push-up position - hands under shoulders, body in straight line from head to heels. Core braced.
          
          Execution: Drive one knee toward chest, then quickly switch legs as if running in place. Keep hips down and core tight throughout.
          
          Key points: Can go slow for ab focus or fast for cardio. Don't let hips pike up or sag down. Keep shoulders over hands. Great for lower abs and hip flexors while also building conditioning.
